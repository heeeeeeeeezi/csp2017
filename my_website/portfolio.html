    <h3>Using Scratch, my partner and I design a pong starter game in order to earn project credit. We added four
        scripts, and the point/second system to make the game more interesting. To make it more colorful, we also
        added more commands like when touch the ball, change the color effect by 25. </h3>

    <h3>Using MIT APPINVENTOR2, my partner and I remixed the game called "space invaders." This
        remix is very challenging to both of us because the MIT APPINVENTOR2's system is different
        from Scratch which we are more familiar to use. </h3>
